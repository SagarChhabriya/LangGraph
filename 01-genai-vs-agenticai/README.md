### GenAI
GenAI, or Generative AI, refers to a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, audio, and video, based on existing data. It utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses, realistic visuals, and creative compositions. Essentially, GenAI models are trained on massive datasets and can then generate novel content that resembles what they've learned. 

- LLM Based apps like ChatGPT
- Diffusion Models for Images
- Code Generating LLMs like CodeLlama
- TTS models like ElevenLabs
- Video gen models like Sora

### GenAI vs Traditional AI

- Traditional AI is about finding patterns in data and giving predictions.
- Generative AI is about learning the distribution of data so that it can generate a new sample from it.

The best part of Generative AI is that it can mimic humans.

### Applications
- Creative and Business Writing
- Software Development
- Customer Support
- Education
- Designing



### AgenticAI
Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to act autonomously, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals with minimal human supervision.

It's characterized by its ability to adapt to changing environments, learn from interactions, and solve complex 
problems independently. Essentially, it's about creating AI agents that can handle tasks and processes with a degree of autonomy, unlike traditional AI systems that require constant human direction. 

### GenAI vs AgenticAI
Generative AI (GenAI) focuses on creating new content like text, images, or code, while Agentic AI is designed for autonomous action, enabling systems to make decisions and take actions to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. Essentially, GenAI is about "creating," while Agentic AI is about "doing".
